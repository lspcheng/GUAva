I have so much love for my culture but it was not an easy road to get here. Many people of color I know struggle with love and acceptance of who they are because we’re brought up to reject it in order to thrive. I don’t think that is right, and I’ve come to learn that it actually does more harm than good. This is actually one of my major reasons why I chose to study Sociology.  I know that everyone has their struggles and their privileges and I did not go into very much detail at the end of my video. But I want to point out that although I talk about how hard it may have been to grow up Asian in America, I also acknowledge how much harder it is to grow up black, muslim, mexican, trans in many different ways,and even more so intersectionally. This is not to compare struggles or disadvantages, but to celebrate adversity. I can only speak from my own experience, but I urge you to share yours!   I have learned the hard way that you cannot force people to accept, appreciate, love your culture, if you yourself do not first.   Anywhoooosies, here are the questions I used so feel free to use them to make your own, switching out the ethnicity as needed xx  Hope you guys enjoyed this video!   1. Do you live in Vietnam? 2. When is the last time you were in Vietnam? 3. What part of the country are you from? 4. What is your Vietnamese name? 5. Name 1 Vietnamese dish you enjoy the most. Why? 6. Do you eat pho on a regular basis? 7. Name 2 Vietnamese household items that best resembles our culture. 8. Do you know how to speak Vietnamese? If so, say a phrase or two. 9. What is a stereotype about Vietnamese people? 10. What is your favorite thing about being Vietnamese?
