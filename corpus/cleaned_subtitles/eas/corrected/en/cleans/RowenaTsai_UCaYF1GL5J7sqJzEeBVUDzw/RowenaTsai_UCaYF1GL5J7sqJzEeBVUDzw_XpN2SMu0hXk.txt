0.03	1.17	Hey guys, welcome back
1.17	7.39	So I recently asked you guys on my Instagram if you had any questions for me regarding college life after college
7.39	14.07	Finding a job career anything that had to do with school and graduation and there's over there's a good amount of questions
14.07	18.46	I typed out a hundred questions and I tried to get them down to about
18.46	20.32	thirty
20.32	23.189	Maybe a little more. I broke them down into five sections
23.189	24.73	the first one will be about
24.73	29.25	Context and background about my experience what I majored in what school I went to what grades I got
29.25	32.28	do I think grades are important and then the second section will be
32.28	35.72	Finding your thing or like finding your purpose finding your career
35.72	39.66	slash calling and then we'll talk about life post grad my current career path
39.66	45.309	Which is mostly YouTube and media and the last section will be about life advices in general. So
45.309	50.399	Yeah, m- there's a lot of questions gonna try to get through them ASAP. And so let's get started
50.399	52.57	Thank you so much to Skillshare for sponsoring this video
52.57	56.969	They're my favorite online learning community and if you guys have been around you will know this by now
56.969	64.51	they're as always offering the first five hundred people a two month free trial I'll get to this a little bit later and uh 
64.51	68.89	Let's get started
68.89	73.29	How did you know what you wanted to do I had no idea what I wanted to do graduating from college
73.29	77.08	I had no idea I would be sitting here five years later
77.08	82.02	Making a video about my college experience. What was your major in college? What made you choose it?
82.02	84.729	I majored in business and then I chose that because-
84.729	89.729	I could dabble in a lot of things within business because there's marketing there's finance. There's accounting
89.729	93.009	there's so many things within business that- allowed for
93.009	98.439	Flexibility for me to choose and for me to figure out as I go. How to be happy when you're in a university,
98.439	103.509	which isn't your dream university? you can always transfer the only colleges
103.509	110.74	That I got into after high school were state colleges in California. So the Cal States and UC Riverside. I
110.74	115.68	Went to UC Riverside because that was the best option and they gave me a decent amount of scholarship
115.68	120.13	I knew going in like this is the most important part I knew going and I was gonna transfer
120.13	127.39	Regardless if it was one year two year three years. I was gonna transfer to either a better UC a better UC um
127.39	133.11	UCLA UC Berkeley or I was gonna transfer to USC and thankfully everything worked out within one year so as with anything in life
133.11	137.73	If there's a way if there's a will if there's a will there's a way yep_unn yep_unn yep_unn yep_unn
137.73	140.91	Did you work during school and if so, how did you find balance?
140.91	147.46	I worked every summer starting from my junior year of high school. Senior year of college. I was working
147.46	151.47	While I was going to school so I stacked there's_unn something_unn here_unn that_unn wants_unn to_unn come_unn out_unn
151.47	157.51	But_unn it's_unn not_unn coming_unn out_unn I stacked my classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. So it was from like eight AM To four PM
157.51	158.91	Or six PM whole day
158.91	165.19	of back to back to back classes so that Monday Wednesdays and Fridays I could work and I was working at a social media agency. Are grades
165.19	170.44	important? and we stress about getting good grades so much that we don't live in the moment
170.44	172.38	This is tricky. I want to say no
172.38	178.35	But it's also a yes because it really depends on what you wanna do after you graduate- the internships that I have one was
178.35	185.02	at a granola bar company called this bar saves lives for every bar that you buy- they will give a
185.02	190.92	Life saving bar to a kid in need. It's kinda like Toms- a for profit but for good one for one model
190.92	192.31	So I worked at companies like that
192.31	196.0	Most of my other friends are going to consulting and investment banking
196.0	200.59	'cause those are like the legit jobs and- when you were in a hyper competitive environment
200.59	203.59	Where everyone's studying business and I was in a business fraternity
203.59	209.37	you kind of get tunnel vision and you just want to be the best and that's kinda what the best things were but I
209.37	214.33	Was like hah I'm just gonna do me even if people think I'm not as legit, which they did
214.33	217.709	They thought I wasn't legit because I didn't have a fancy job
217.709	223.3	But I was like I just- just_unn gonna_unn do_unn me_unn just_unn wanna- just_unn wanna_unn be_unn happy_unn grand scheme of things
223.3	229.65	I don't think grades matter at all because the fact that we're alive and that we're breathing and that we were born
229.65	236.17	is like a oneth in a billionth chance. So why limit ourselves and why define ourselves by grades?
236.17	237.82	but then again
237.82	241.83	If you know a career you want and grades are important then grades are important
241.83	249.42	Do you have good grades in university? I graduated with barely a three point oh I think I had a three point oh one or three point oh two
249.42	254.269	So no, but I'm proud of myself for graduating with a three point above a three point oh GPA
254.269	259.5	How do you stay happy in college through all of the stress? so I stay happy through
259.5	265.169	Drinking and partying and going to raves and having fun with my friends and I put more emphasis on that
265.169	266.91	Than I did on my studies
266.91	272.76	but the thing is I kinda shot myself in the foot because I wasn't even happy when I was doing that I was
272.76	279.199	Doing that because I was avoiding reality. I was avoiding my responsibilities and the thoughts in my head and I was avoiding myself
279.199	282.27	I was avoid facing myself. So would I
282.27	284.03	Wish this upon anyone else
284.03	284.81	I don't think so
284.81	290.7	But I would say that I think it's so important to enjoy our youths. I don't regret anything I did because now
290.7	291.68	That I'm here
291.68	294.11	I'm like, okay been there done that never wanna be there again
294.11	300.96	But I know what it's like so I think it's important that amidst burying- yourself in books and studying
300.96	305.669	To pull your head out every once in a while. Go out, have fun with your friends go
305.669	313.169	Enjoy being a teen or like a twenty something year old because we're never gonna get that back the older you get the more
313.169	317.0	Responsibilities you have and I guess on that note if I could do it all over again
317.0	319.4	I would spend more time getting to know myself for sure
319.4	326.88	I didn't know how to do it back then looking inward reflecting asking myself the hard questions so that I'm not just like
326.88	332.91	Avoiding and running away all the time and also to not take office hours professors
332.91	340.729	School like offerings like our school our universities. There's so many resources that I just completely like I didn't care most important thing
340.729	345.3	I took for granted was the proximity in which I lived with my friends now I'm in New York
345.3	349.5	most of my friends are in San Francisco or LA so it's like uh- ha-
349.5	350.9	You can't really you know and- I-
350.9	359.88	I suck at keeping in touch via phones and messages like I'm really good with people when I'm like face to face, but I'm terrible with k-
359.88	362.16	Keeping up with people through texting um
362.16	364.68	so that's something I'm working on but
364.68	369.68	That's that. How to be mindful over y- your future rather than let fear of it stress you out?
369.68	374.95	So I'm reading this really great book called ten percent happier, and I'm gonna read a quote striving_unn is_unn fine_unn
374.95	376.61	as_unn long_unn as_unn it's_unn tempered_unn by_unn the_unn
376.61	384.11	Realization_unn that_unn in_unn an_unn entropic_unn universe_unn the_unn final_unn outcome_unn is_unn out_unn of_unn your_unn control_unn if_unn you_unn don't_unn waste_unn your_unn energy_unn on_unn variables_unn you_unn cannot_unn influence_unn
384.11	390.919	You_unn can_unn focus_unn much_unn more_unn effectively_unn on_unn those_unn you_unn can_unn when_unn you_unn are_unn wisely_unn ambitious_unn you_unn do_unn everything_unn you_unn can_unn to_unn succeed_unn
390.919	393.01	But_unn you_unn are_unn not_unn attached_unn to_unn the_unn outcome_unn I think
393.01	397.76	this is the most important you're not attached to the outcome so_unn that_unn if_unn you_unn fail_unn you_unn will_unn be_unn
397.76	402.16	Maximally_unn resilient_unn able_unn to_unn get_unn up_unn dust_unn yourself_unn off_unn and_unn get_unn back_unn in_unn the_unn fray_unn
402.16	406.37	Do you believe in five year plans or do you think you should take life as it hits yeah?
406.37	414.59	So I was a firm believer in the five year plan in the one three five and ten year plan. That was
414.59	420.14	Textbook Rowena, but over the years, especially when I started YouTube. I just realized that
420.14	428.21	Life is constantly changing 'cause- you wanna control what You can so I've learned to accept and embrace uncertainty as
428.21	435.229	My reality instead of tryna line- everything down to the T because no matter how much you plan
435.229	436.82	Things are gonna happen
436.82	439.07	Things aren't gonna go p- according to plan
439.07	445.61	Historically. I've been a very J like a hardcore J from the myers briggs like judgment
445.61	446.96	judgmental
446.96	455.08	Something with a J I've learned to become more perceiving. I've learned to become more go with the flow take life as it comes
455.08	458.56	Like enjoy the breeze and not to be so anal with planning
458.56	462.979	So yeah, I think I'm more of the latter now take life as it hits. Yeah
462.979	469.19	That made me giggle. Okay. What can I do to support my bestie who is in college and horribly burnt out
469.19	469.82	aw
469.82	474.05	I'd say kidnap your bestie to go on a BFF date and
474.05	480.32	If she's like I cannot leave my studies for more than X amount of time then just take her to grab food
480.32	483.97	Get her mind off of her studies when you're so in something
483.97	488.06	You need to be peeled out and peeled off and I think in retrospect
488.06	493.27	Me and all my friends as much as we might have not liked you the moment
493.27	497.289	You're like ripping us away from our studies in the long run
497.289	505.25	It was like thank_unn you_unn think now looking back it's definitely like a thank you for looking out for me
505.25	512.659	What do I do if I can't find a purpose right after school? I'm scared of becoming stagnant. The thing with finding your purpose
512.659	519.05	I was disillusioned when I thought that after I found my purpose my life would just be smooth sailing
519.05	525.25	but no you will find your purpose and then you'll be tested again and then you'll kinda forget and then you'll find it again and then you'll kinda
525.25	528.19	lose it again and then you kinda find it again. I think that's just life
528.19	532.279	We as humans are constantly changing and growing so our North Star
532.279	538.18	May be implanted in the sky for the foreseeable future, but the closer you get to it
538.18	540.49	You might be able to see it from a different perspective
540.49	541.19	so
541.19	547.6	Although your North Star doesn't change you're constantly changing and the way in which you get to that North Star or like follow that
547.6	555.5	North Star may also change as well. So I think what's most important is to never stop learning always stay curious with a growth mindset
555.5	559.91	you can't go wrong and you won't be stagnant because if you're always
559.91	564.92	Willing to learn if you're always questioning if you're always curious about the world around you
564.92	571.43	That's the recipe for not staying stagnant a few ways that I've continued to learn after I graduated
571.43	578.26	One is through reading. I love business and self help books and I just recently got into more like fiction books
578.26	580.3	I think sometimes they're too wild and crazy for me
580.3	585.26	But it is great to let your mind explore and implant your brain into different
585.26	589.24	Universes every once in a while. And another way is through online courses like Skillshare
589.24	595.67	So Skillshare is an online learning community with over twenty five thousand classes in design business
595.67	600.16	Creativity anything artsy you can think of how to edit videos how to paint
600.16	602.68	There's actually a course on there that I wanna share with you guys
602.68	607.959	It's called Discovering success seven exercises to uncover your purpose passion and path
607.959	612.49	I think this is great for anyone who is kind of like what_unn do_unn I_unn do_unn
612.49	617.18	I kind of have this creative thing that I wanna do, but there's also this like more stable
617.18	620.66	Financially sound path that I wanna walk like which path do I take?
620.66	625.329	She does a really good job of breaking everything down and I talked about these things in my older videos
625.329	631.84	but never in depth like this, so it's like redefining what success means to you breaking free of expectations
631.84	633.46	Going back to the beginning
633.46	638.01	Listening to what you love choosing a direction managing your time money strategies
638.01	639.79	so I think all of these are really
639.79	645.029	Important things and topics there's not as many crash courses on this like you don't learn about these things in school
645.029	650.14	This is something you're interested in the first five hundred people will get a two month premium
650.14	655.48	Membership trial which will give you access to all of the courses on Skillshare. So
655.48	657.55	there's that
657.55	663.94	Moving on I got rejected from nursing school three times and I don't know what to do from here. Do I change paths? I
663.94	667.23	Think this comes down to how badly do you want to be a nurse?
667.23	670.02	If you know it is your life's calling if you know
670.02	677.2	I must be a nurse because you love helping people and you want to help save lives then
677.2	679.92	Keep applying and don't take no for an answer
679.92	686.2	And I think this is with anything in life any job that you're thinking of if you want something badly enough. You're gonna keep
686.2	690.6	Trying until you get a yes, but if you ask yourself and you're like
690.6	692.8	w- I think I wanna be a nurse 'cause
692.8	699.1	It's what is expected of me or it's what I thought I should do because of something other than what you wanted to do for
699.1	701.05	Yourself then maybe
701.05	708.07	Maybe it's a sign from the universe that you- you should pivot but these answers only we will know we spend the quiet hours
708.07	709.51	with our own thoughts
709.51	715.06	Late at night or early in the mornings when you're just questioning everything
715.06	720.339	Okay_unn Advice on choosing the career you want versus the career that pays better? it's tough
720.339	725.95	So there's two things. The first thing I wanna say is the career that pays well is like a steady_unn
725.95	728.91	Pay right and then maybe by the time you're sixty
728.91	737.23	You're like here the career that you want may not pay well in the beginning. There's three years five years. You might be making nothing
737.23	740.8	But the potential of it growing
740.8	745.209	Exponentially is a lot more than that like stable career path um
745.209	748.709	Or there's a lot more potential and possibility for it to grow
748.709	754.06	So that's the first thing question that I ask myself is long term fulfillment versus short term satis- satisfaction
754.06	761.15	I think a stable career path definitely falls into short term satisfaction because you don't really have to think about most things and you kind of 
761.15	765.63	Have your life planned out for you long term fur- ful- fulfillment?
765.63	771.29	If you're gonna eventually do what you wanna do, which is what I think most rational humans go through
771.29	773.07	That's why we have midlife crises
773.07	778.32	Where we doubt everything and we question everything and we look back and like why did I live my life for the past
778.32	784.17	Five decades like this when it's not what I wanted to do or it's not who I am what really helped me
784.17	790.88	Stay true to my path and to not waver when I wave- I wavered a lot actually
790.88	796.14	But what helped me stay grounded was that if you're going to go down this path eventually
796.14	800.36	Might as well go down it now how to stay positive when others are doubting my next steps?
800.36	806.67	I really think it's self awareness. If you know yourself well enough, you know what you're doing if you know why you're doing what you're doing
806.67	808.38	Which can change
808.38	810.06	and which can be
810.06	816.12	Cloudy at times, but if you have a decent enough understanding, it'll allow you to
816.12	820.92	Not care as much about what others say or tell you uh
820.92	824.31	But that being said it's good to it's good to listen
824.31	831.48	To what other people are saying and it's good to listen to their advices whether you take it or not. It's fully up to yourself
831.48	837.89	Okay_unn Advice for graduates who've decided to take creative and unconventional paths?
837.89	840.5	I don't know why that was so choppy when I was just reading it
840.5	844.59	I think the hardest part is over taking that leap of faith believing in yourself and
844.59	850.76	Working through all the knots and the mess in your head to be like, I'm gonna do this. So keep doing it
850.76	857.6	But also remember if you have to pivot and change your course and change your path as you walk this path
857.6	860.33	It's not failure, right? You're not failing
860.33	866.16	if you didn't do the thing you set out to do I think life is a continual process of
866.16	868.17	iterations and pivoting and
868.17	874.32	changing and I've always thought a path is like this but I think life is actually more like this and sometimes like
874.32	876.06	You know
876.06	881.91	Okay_unn what helped you find your purpose and how did you know that you found it? This question is gonna take way too long
881.91	883.4	I'll link two videos down below
883.4	886.19	I mean I hate when people do this because like just_unn tell_unn me_unn now_unn
886.19	893.16	But seriously I- I have two other videos one is about how I created my dream job and the second is how I found my life purpose
893.16	900.75	So those two will be linked down below* below how many years passed after graduation when you were content with your place and life
900.75	905.94	so I was content the day I graduated I was so happy the day I graduated I was like
905.94	911.48	Yes_unn I don't know school wasn't really for me. I don't really learn in that like school environment
911.48	913.25	I wasn't good at taking tests
913.25	919.34	Thankfully- I didn't let that define me too much because I knew I had strengths outside of taking tests
919.34	920.43	but when I
920.43	925.97	Finally felt like I could breathe and that I could look at myself in the mirror and tell myself you did
925.97	928.32	Well Rowena child you did well um
928.32	932.91	It was actually earlier this year
932.91	938.76	Most difficult adjustment you had to make going into life post graduation. I think the most
938.76	945.29	Difficult thing I think it's not comparing myself to those around me because the path that I chose for myself was very different
945.29	946.7	It wasn't what other people were doing
946.7	951.8	And it's so easy to look around me and to be like all of my friends already started working all of my friends
951.8	953.42	have started making money all my friends
953.42	958.14	They're doing the things already and it just felt like I was gonna fall behind
958.14	964.53	I already fell behind because I didn't go down that path but then I just kept reminding myself the whole
964.53	971.01	short term satisfaction versus long term gain um short term satisfaction would have been to pet my ego and to
971.01	976.08	Do what? I thought I should do but I knew long term
976.08	982.01	That was gonna make me happy. What do you wish you had done in your final year to prepare you for life after graduation?
982.01	988.11	I think going back to what I said earlier. I wish I spent more time in here like trying to work out
988.11	994.08	this and like this and being a better friend to myself and trying to get to know myself better um 'cause
994.08	997.73	I did a lot of that after graduating, but if I'd started doing that in college
997.73	1004.01	I think that would have helped a_unn lot_unn a_unn lot_unn has graduation helped define you as a person and what success means to you?
1004.01	1008.12	has graduation helped define you as a person, um
1008.12	1011.33	Not really. I feel like I don't really talk about
1011.33	1012.8	USC
1012.8	1014.54	at all after
1014.54	1020.209	Graduating I realized I like found my definition of success and it definitely wasn't my grades
1020.209	1022.17	It wasn't the fact that I graduated
1022.17	1029.549	It wasn't the job that I would get I think success to me at that time was just being able to find
1029.549	1034.37	The answer to what it means to live a meaningful and fulfilling life
1034.37	1038.72	I think that was what my definition was of success at that time
1038.72	1040.669	And it's constantly changing
1040.669	1045.35	I think now for me talked about this in my podcast with Eileen from <unk>
1045.35	1051.659	I think success to me now me- it- just means like being able to go to sleep at night content with
1051.659	1057.539	how the day went I mean d- it's very like there's a lot of layers to that um
1057.539	1064.679	Me being able to go to sleep content is that I did my best in everything that I could during the day for work
1064.679	1070.02	by helping people because my work is trying to help people in many different ways either through
1070.02	1072.049	Beauty within, or through my own personal channel
1072.049	1077.58	so there's a lotta layers to that but I think at the end of the day like the- our definition of success should
1077.58	1082.2	Be defined by ourselves, and it's normal if it changes over time
1082.2	1085.35	'cause_unn we're_unn constantly_unn changing_unn as_unn people_unn
1085.35	1087.87	ever felt lost
1087.87	1091.76	pr- pre- pre- p- p- Professionally post college. If so, how did you deal slash break out of it? Yeah, dude
1091.76	1099.09	I felt professionally lost up until I'd say last year. So I graduated two thousand fourteen
1099.09	1103.38	two thousand fourteen t- fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen. Four years
1103.38	1109.34	Four years, I was like, what am I doing with my life? Did I make the right decisions? Why am I here?
1109.34	1113.6	What is the right path is there even a right path? And the answer I talked about in last week's video
1113.6	1118.13	I don't really think there is a right path. I think our path is a culmination of the decisions
1118.13	1119.789	We've made in our lives and eventually
1119.789	1121.25	It'd- like it's there already
1121.25	1126.649	if you believe in fate if you believe in destiny like our path is there we just need to walk it and if so,
1126.649	1128.69	How did you deal slash
1128.69	1132.53	Break out of it. Just have to keep walking. Even if it's blind faith
1132.53	1134.34	Even if it's with mustering
1134.34	1141.2	every ounce of courage you have in the depths of your soul to just like trust yourself and trust the universe to move forward and
1141.2	1142.38	It goes back to learning
1142.38	1143.669	staying curious
1143.669	1150.72	Trying your best and not being attached to the end results how difficult was it to move to New York City. Did you do it alone?
1150.72	1153.48	It wasn't difficult at all. And yes, I did it alone
1153.48	1160.799	How long did it take to fully transition from moving across the country to New York? I think
1160.799	1165.98	because I moved around so often when I was young it just like it wasn't a thing
1165.98	1170.669	I just knew I needed- I wanted to be in New York. And so I just went and I just
1170.669	1173.909	Lived and I- it just kinda happened um ow
1173.909	1177.0	Did you want to continue studying to avoid working?
1177.0	1182.149	Absolutely not. I hated studying. I couldn't wait to graduate from high school college
1182.149	1187.77	I think I had more fun. But I also no- no I don't like studying at all
1187.77	1193.799	All right. Now we're gonna move to career slash youtube.
1193.799	1201.539	I Think I'll do a separate video answering your guys's questions about YouTube starting YouTube wanting to start YouTube advice for starting YouTube um
1201.539	1203.809	But this one it's a little it's a little more broad
1203.809	1207.86	How do you decide what to do in life slash as a career when you're not sure what you enjoy?
1207.86	1213.95	I think just constant forward movement or just constant movement. It could be lateral. It could be vertical
1213.95	1219.149	it could be any type of movement but as long as you're trying as long as you're actively
1219.149	1224.07	Engaging yourself and everything in you to try new things
1224.07	1229.97	You will find your thing eventually when I graduated. I thought I was gonna start my own business that didn't happen
1229.97	1234.409	We can just say it failed. uh I thought I was gonna code 'cause- I love tech startups
1234.409	1240.51	So I was like I could do that UX UI that seems really cool. But like that also didn't really go anywhere because I couldn't
1240.51	1242.61	Like I just- I can't
1242.61	1246.0	like the l- the coding language just
1246.0	1254.07	Symbols and numbers just didn't work with me and my_unn neighbor's_unn dog_unn is_unn just_unn right_unn outside_unn So_unn you_unn might_unn hear_unn the_unn dog_unn barking_unn
1254.07	1260.039	went into media work never in a million years would I thought I would work in journalism or at a media company because
1260.039	1266.52	My focus was very tech and business and then started my youtube channel and start helping on beauty within
1266.52	1269.58	It just kinda all came together as I like progressed in life
1269.58	1271.49	and throughout this whole journey
1271.49	1273.299	it was a lot of um
1273.299	1277.34	Lot of wavering a lot of back and forth a lot of doubting a lot of questioning of what is the right path
1277.34	1282.15	What is the right thing to do? That's why I said it a little earlier that there really is no right path
1282.15	1288.57	Just keep walking and keep believing in yourself. Keep questioning yourself, like healthily questioning yourself
1288.57	1293.14	um reminding yourself of who you are and what you're doing. Why are you doing what you're doing?
1293.14	1298.66	um And then eventually the path will reveal itself as it did with me
1298.66	1302.95	Yeah_unn when should I really start applying for jobs?
1302.95	1305.29	This is really up to you um
1305.29	1311.5	if you want advice as a Marshall School graduate um
1311.5	1315.49	You would start your sophomore year of
1315.49	1323.28	college applying for internships because that's how competitive people are nowadays you get an internship sophomore junior year at a
1323.28	1329.11	Big firm, they will most likely give you an offer when you graduate your senior year
1329.11	1334.63	But if you ask Rowena Rowena, when's the best time to apply for college?
1334.63	1338.94	It's_unn up_unn to_unn you_unn dude_unn Maybe you don't want to apply to jobs. Maybe you do want to apply to jobs
1338.94	1344.47	What jobs do you wanna apply for? I think those are questions that only you'll be able to answer for yourself
1344.47	1348.33	Do companies actually prefer someone with a college degree for a job in your industry
1348.33	1352.59	So I think it depends um if you want to work on like the agency side
1352.59	1354.79	I think it helps to have a degree
1354.79	1358.38	To- to an extent most corporations do look at your resume
1358.38	1363.22	They kinda do care what- that like you went to college at least
1363.22	1365.71	But what I'm doing right now
1365.71	1373.81	Like as a creator you can have zero degree and you can create content anyone can create content
1373.81	1377.2	How to find work in the media industry when it's so competitive
1377.2	1380.22	So I think with this it's it doesn't matter if it's media
1380.22	1382.12	It doesn't matter what industry that you're going for
1382.12	1385.83	I think going back to the whole Dyson analogy of if you want something badly enough
1385.83	1388.14	You won't stop until you get a yes
1388.14	1392.95	and one thing that I was actually pretty surprised to find was that you can
1392.95	1398.29	Use your student card so hard so reach out to ten people on LinkedIn
1398.29	1403.75	who has a job that you might be interested in and ask for an informational interview and
1403.75	1407.5	What this means is that you can just ask them about their career ask them about
1407.5	1413.74	Their life their path how they got there and you'd be surprised at least two out of ten. People will say yes to you
1413.74	1419.59	It's a natural human instinct to want to help other people if you reach out as a student and you say like hey
1419.59	1421.7	I'm not really sure what I wanna do with my life
1421.7	1423.64	Maybe don't say that be a little more professional
1423.64	1428.95	but if you allude to that then the person reading it like a professional reading that would be like, oh
1428.95	1433.22	I remember what it was like when I graduated so like yes, yas_unn Yas_unn
1433.22	1439.28	I will help you asking people who're already there for their thoughts and their- advice
1439.28	1443.54	that's really probably like the best way to go and
1443.54	1450.17	Also send your resume to as many people as you can don't be afraid of being annoying message recruiters
1450.17	1452.059	Keep in touch with recruiters
1452.059	1460.01	There's a lot that you can do go to career fairs get to know the recruiters from different companies that you wanna work at uh
1460.01	1465.679	There's a lot yeah not being afraid of getting no's and also not being afraid of being
1465.679	1471.62	mildly moderately annoying persistence for the most part will always work in your favor and
1471.62	1477.95	moving on to the last section of life advice
1477.95	1483.59	What are lessons you've learned in college that you still value today?
1483.59	1487.79	What did I learn in college ?
1487.79	1492.16	Think I learned a lot about what I don't wanna do and how I don't wanna feel yeah
1492.16	1497.3	I think that's probably the biggest takeaway how lost and how
1497.3	1505.16	Alone and how down I felt it's a really good gauge for me to never return to that
1505.16	1506.57	lifestyle and that
1506.57	1513.74	Stage of my life the partying the drinking the avoiding the running away the not facing myself not facing my reality
1513.74	1521.69	yeah, I think that's probably the biggest takeaway one piece of advice you'd give yourself if you went back in time to
1521.69	1525.5	two thousand and fourteen
1525.5	1531.23	uh Everything that I say will probably be very cliche, but I think the most important thing would be
1531.23	1532.88	You're not alone
1532.88	1534.71	Everything will work out
1534.71	1537.14	don't stop dreaming and
1537.14	1542.74	Keep fighting for what you believe in. Yeah, I think those are like the four most important things
1542.74	1543.88	Yeah
1543.88	1546.97	This is why my channel exists if I can help
1546.97	1549.82	Even one of you guys feel less alone and less crazy
1549.82	1555.7	for dreaming the way you dream and for wanting to do the things you wanna do then I've
1555.7	1557.68	succeeded
1557.68	1559.03	Navigating life is never easy
1559.03	1565.62	finding your purpose is never easy finding your why is never easy and it's it's the most difficult because it's something that we have to
1565.62	1567.37	Do and we can only do?
1567.37	1575.11	On our own but we don't have to as in like the answers you will find yourself and it's like it's very personal
1575.11	1581.92	But the journey you don't have to go through that alone. And I think that's what I learned few years after I graduated so
1581.92	1582.72	with all of that
1582.72	1586.74	I_unn hope_unn this_unn video_unn was_unn helpful_unn and that you guys got something out of it
