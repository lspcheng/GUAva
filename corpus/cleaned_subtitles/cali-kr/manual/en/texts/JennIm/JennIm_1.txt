and I am so excited to film this video for you guys because the month of May is Asian Pacific Heritage Month and in the spirit of that I thought that it would be very timely to do the Asian American tag I wanted to share with you guys my experience growing up Asian American and my friend Amy gave this whole concept structure and made it very simple by creating questions and so I just wanna dive right into it so let's get started I am Korean-American I was born and raised in Southern California So my parents immigrated from Korea and they first moved to Chile and that's where my mom had my brother but after my parents got their green card they were able to come to America and they had me And so I would categorize me and my brother as first-generation because like my parents didn't speak any English so we were truly the first generation to really grow up American here The first experience when I realized that I was different from the rest of the kids was when I was in first or second grade my mom packed my favorite food which was kare rice which is basically just curry with rice and it has vegetables and meat and it's so delicious and I remember being so excited to eat it for lunchtime and when I opened the Tupperware I remember a kid looking at it and just being so disgusted and he just called me out he was like and I remember being so mortified and so embarrassed and I just completely lost my appetite and I don't I didn't even eat that lunch and when I got home I told my Mom that I never wanted her to pack things like this again I told her that I only wanted her to pack like Lunchables and sandwiches just like normal American food so that I would fit in When I was younger there was a period where I was super proud to be Korean It happened when I was around like nine years old My mom took me and my brother to Korea for the entire summer and we stayed at my aunt's and it was such an amazing experience because for once like I realized like that everyone looked like me and I felt really just like I just felt like I connected with everybody and I remember always hanging out at this park where all the kids used to hang out and I made a lot of friends because everyone was so fascinated at the fact that I was American And so I would bring like chapter books that I'd packed and I'd be like speaks in foreign language and everyone was like so impressed and it was just it was just a really great time for me and that's when I was really just like proud of my culture and when I brought that back to America like that that pride stayed there for a little bit until I went to middle school and middle school was when everything just kind of changed for me I feel like it was a lot of factors just hitting all when I was like 11 It was puberty it was the fact that I was like chubby and then the fact that like there weren't that many Asians in my school I remember there was a group of these boys that walked the same route as me home and I remember hating when we would like cross paths because they would always say something to me and they would say something so like racist They would say things like Hey chink do you wanna do my homework or Hey you dropped your calculator and now I wish that I had the strength to just clap back at them because at the time I just didn't say anything I was so scared I was I was genuinely afraid of my for I was afraid for my life and I wish that I had the courage to just like stand up to them and be like but unfortunately I wasn't like that I think this also crossed at the same path when my parents made me go to Korean school on Saturday and I was so pissed that they were making me and my brother go to school an extra day Like we already had Monday through Friday and now they're adding like a whole new curriculum for Saturday and like we also they also made us go to church every Sunday so I felt like I had no days off like ugh So we had to go to Korean school and there was this one instance with a teacher that just really stuck with me She was telling us that when people ask us what our ethnicity is we need to say that we are Korean-American The Korean always has to be first and I remember being very unsettled by it because I felt like in my heart that I was American so I rose my hand and I told her my piece and she said No you are always going to be Korean And I just said like Why can't I just be American I just felt like this big distance between my culture and what I was brought into I associated being Korean as a negative thing because number one the bullying sucked and number two I would see the way people would treat my parents Like my parents didn't speak English very well I would just see the way people would treat my parents because of their accent People lose their temper people get frustrated people treat you like you're an idiot when you have an accent and it just really frustrated me and my Mom is already kind of a shy timid person and I think when she was thrown into this world in America as like a foreign person I think that just made her reclusive even more One stereotype that I absolutely struggled with growing up was the model minority stereotype The fact that all Asians are amazing at crunching numbers and they're just really great academically blah blah blah and I think from an outsider's perspective people might think wow like that's actually a really good stereotype like people just think you're really smart but it puts a lot of pressure on you especially when you are not academically smart Like I growing up I tried my best to be a good student Like I would literally spend hours and hours doing my homework and all this stuff and it just wouldn't register to me Like I was always like a B minus C student like one time I got a D and like in an Asian household like that is unacceptable like my B minuses were such disappointments to my parents and they would always compare me to like other kids and because I wasn't the best student I felt this distance between my Asian American peers that were very studious so I just found like a new group of friends Like friends that I can connect with artistically and creatively and obviously like there was Asian Americans there too but it was like a whole mix and it was really cool like we would you know burn CDs for each other we would go to shows we'd go thrifting and I felt really blessed that I was able to have my own community in high school Yes I can speak Korean I would probably say I speak the equivalent of like a seven year old maybe a six year old now Like I know how to get by I know you know how to ask for directions order food have like light conversation but anything with depth I'm just like ugh like I don't know When I watch the Korean news I'm just kinda like I don't know what they're saying They have to talk a lot slower It was a lot better when I was living with my parents obviously like I speak Conglish with my parents so I'll speak Korean and then I'll just fill in English words where I don't know the Korean words I just don't understand like where did all those years of Korean school go like did I just bury them in a box Like it's I don't know but I want to change this desperately and so I'm just gonna do like an open call now I'm looking for a Korean tutor if you are based in the Los Angeles area I would love for you to DM me on my Instagram it's IMJENNIM I guess you just tell me your name your age what school you go to or if you did and just like what kind of program would you put me on for ya know my Korean tutoring session Being Korean-American absolutely affected my relationship with my parents There was a lot of frustration and anger because of all the miscommunication that would happen There were so many times where I would just try to talk to my parents but there are just words that I just didn't know and vice versa and we would just have yelling matches I would scream at them being like and they would just say like Why don't you know Korean And so it always felt like this battle and growing up my entire life I felt this huge disconnect from my brain and my mouth like I felt like I couldn't say exactly what I was feeling or I couldn't articulate and put into words so writing was a nightmare for me I hated writing because I would just look at the paper and be like I just don't know what to say I don't know like maybe was it because I was juggling two languages like I don't know I mean but I just look at other people and I see like you grew up with like four languages and you're fine so I don't know maybe it's just like a personal thing but I've always had trouble communicating and so with my parents with that language barrier it was just like an extra level of just ugh just fogginess and I just I was just very angry growing up and I feel really bad for my parents because when I was a teenager I was not I mean I was kind of a nightmare so now I wanna chat about the power dynamics because I feel like that was kind of off with my parents because when we were at home obviously my parents were in charge so we'd listen to them but when we were out and about we would always be translating and speaking especially for my Mom and it's because my Mom is a very shy and fearful person and I don't know if she was always this way because I didn't know her when she was younger but I think it's because of the judgment that people would give because something really traumatic happened to her while she was out here so So when I was in preschool I remembered my Dad picked me up from school and I knew something was wrong because normally my Mom picks me up from school so we go home and I go to my parents' room and I see my Mom just lying on the bed with a towel on her face and so I asked my Dad like Is everything okay and he says Oh she's just napping We found out later that someone had robbed the store My parents had a really small shop that sold women's clothes in El Monte and someone had a knife and he told her to give her the money in the register and my Mom refused because that was all the money we had and so she said no and he sliced her face and of course he took the money and she was a very fearful fearful person after that She never spoke and I think it took her a very long time to recover from that and when she told me that story again when I was older it just it just lit a fire in me like I because I never want my parents to be in a situation like that ever again and the reason why I'm telling you this story is because I feel like first-generation parents they have to do the shitty jobs They have to work in the dangerous locations The have to work at the salon the convenience stores and they do this because they want to give us a better life and so it makes me want to try so hard and to be able to provide for them and so that they never have to worry about that again Every day I'm so grateful that they chose to move here to give me and my brother a better life to give all of us a better life and whenever I'm feeling unmotivated or I feel like I just can't do it I think of that and it just snaps me right back up and it just fuels me to push harder I feel so proud to be Korean-American now and it definitely took some time I think it's because the older I got the more I just had to accept myself and I started to embrace my heritage when I was probably like a senior in high school to a freshman in college I think that's when I realized I can't change who I am so I have to accept it and I really hope that people don't judge me for wanting to distance myself from my culture because I think it all came from a place of me just really wanting to fit in and really wanting for people to like me I'm here now and I'm so freaking proud to be Korean-American and I want to specify that I'm both In America generally people just see me as an Asian and when I go back to Korea or when people or Asian Americans go back to their motherland people categorize us as Americans so we don't fully belong in either We're in our own category and I'm not mad about that I love the fact that I can have the best of both worlds It's like the Hannah Montana song My favorite thing about being Korean-American is the resilience because I feel like Korea has gone through so much from Imperialism to war and now the fact that we are one of the major players in the economy just fills me with so much pride like we are killing it in the cars the technology the cosmetics entertainment K-Pop is frickin' nuts and K dramas So the fact that we were able to build from nothing in such a short amount of time makes me so proud Like I'm just always cheering on the underdog no matter where you're from where your background is I just love when people realize that it's never too late to evolve All right guys those were all the answers to my tag I would love for you guys to be able to fill out the questions down below whether you wanna do it in a comment or even your own video I wanna know what it was like growing up whatever ethnicity you were Just replace the Korean or Asian to whatever your heritage is and I would love for you to share your experiences It's like we live in this globalized world where we can share our stories we can explain what happened so that way we can learn from it I wanna thank you guys for finishing this video and listening to me because it really really means a lot So thank you for watching bye
